          JanitorForge is an independent creator toolkit for managing bots,
          forms, submissions, profiles, creator pages, collaboration, and
          related content.
        </p>

        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains what information the platform handles,
          why that information is needed, and what choices you have. The goal is
          to keep this understandable instead of filling the page with
          unnecessary legal language.
        </p>

        <p>
          By using JanitorForge, you acknowledge this Privacy Policy. The{" "}

        <Subheading>Account information</Subheading>

        <p>An account currently uses:</p>

        <List>
          <li>
            <Strong>Username</Strong> — the name you choose for your account.
          </li>

          <li>
            <Strong>PIN</Strong> — the code used to authenticate your account.
            Authentication is handled through the platform&apos;s authentication
            system rather than being exposed as readable profile information.
          </li>
        </List>

        <p>
          JanitorForge does not require you to provide a normal email address to
          register. A technical authentication identifier may be created
          internally so the account system can function.
        </p>

        <Subheading>Optional profile information</Subheading>

        <p>
          Depending on what you choose to add, your profile may contain things
          such as:
        </p>

        <List>
          <li>Display name, pronouns, bio, tagline, and status.</li>
          <li>Avatar and banner images.</li>
          <li>Location or website information you choose to publish.</li>
          <li>Social usernames or links.</li>
          <li>Specialties and profile appearance settings.</li>
        </List>

        <Subheading>Content you create or submit</Subheading>

        <p>
          JanitorForge stores content needed for the features you use. This may
          include:
        </p>

        <List>
          <li>Bots and their character information.</li>
          <li>Forms, form configuration, and submissions.</li>
          <li>Creator Pages and their sections.</li>
          <li>Worlds, lorebooks, and Atlas content.</li>
          <li>Comments, community activity, and reactions.</li>
          <li>Collaboration records and activity.</li>
          <li>Feedback, bug reports, or suggestions you send.</li>
        </List>

        <Subheading>Technical and safety information</Subheading>

        <p>
          Hosting, authentication, and security systems may process standard
          technical information needed to operate a web service, such as request
          timestamps, browser or device information, and network information.
        </p>

        <p>
          In particular, public form submissions may involve limited network
          information such as an IP address for purposes including abuse
          prevention, rate limiting, moderation, security review, and blocking
          repeat offenders.
        </p>
      </PolicySection>

      <PolicySection number="03" title="What JanitorForge does not require">
        <p>
          JanitorForge is intentionally designed to require relatively little
          personal information.
        </p>

        <p>The platform does not require:</p>

        <List>
          <li>A real email address to create an account.</li>
          <li>A phone number.</li>
          <li>A physical mailing address.</li>
          <li>Government identification.</li>
          <li>Payment information, since JanitorForge is currently free.</li>
          <li>Biometric information.</li>
          <li>Precise GPS location.</li>
        </List>

        <p>
          This does not prevent users from voluntarily placing personal
          information inside a profile, form response, comment, feedback
          message, or other content field. Please avoid sharing information you
          do not want stored or seen by the relevant audience.
        </p>
      </PolicySection>

      <PolicySection number="04" title="How the information is used">
        <p>
          Information is used only where it is reasonably needed to operate,
          protect, or improve JanitorForge.
        </p>

        <List>
          <li>Authenticate your account and keep it accessible to you.</li>
          <li>Store and display the content you create.</li>
          <li>Deliver and organize form submissions.</li>
          <li>Enable collaboration and notifications.</li>
          <li>Apply profile, resource, and visibility settings.</li>
          <li>Moderate abusive or suspicious submissions.</li>
          <li>Prevent spam, automated abuse, or unauthorized access.</li>
          <li>Respond to feedback and bug reports.</li>
          <li>Maintain and improve platform reliability.</li>
          <li>Comply with applicable legal obligations when required.</li>
        </List>
      </PolicySection>

      <PolicySection number="05" title="Public, private, and shared content">
        <p>
          Some parts of JanitorForge are designed to be public while others are
          private or limited by access settings.
        </p>

        <List>
          <li>
            Profile information may be visible according to your profile
            visibility settings.
          </li>

          <li>
            Content you deliberately publish may be accessible without signing
            in.
          </li>

          <li>
            Public or shareable Forms can be opened by people who receive their
            links.
          </li>

          <li>
            Collaborators can access the shared information permitted by their
            role.
          </li>

          <li>
            Community posts, comments, reactions, and similar public activity
            may be visible to other users.
          </li>
        </List>

        <p>
          Making something public or sharing it with another person means they
          may be able to copy or retain what they can see. JanitorForge cannot
          control what another person does with information after they receive
          it outside the platform.
        </p>
      </PolicySection>

      <PolicySection number="06" title="Infrastructure and service providers">
        <p>
          JanitorForge relies on third-party infrastructure to function. The
          main providers currently include:
        </p>

        <List>
          <li>
            <Strong>Vercel</Strong> — hosting and delivery of the web
            application.
          </li>

          <li>
            <Strong>Supabase</Strong> — authentication, database, and storage
            infrastructure.
          </li>
        </List>

        <p>
          These providers may process technical data as necessary to provide
          their services. JanitorForge does not sell user information to
          advertisers.
        </p>

        <p>
          If infrastructure providers change in the future, this policy may be
          updated accordingly.
        </p>
      </PolicySection>

      <PolicySection number="07" title="Cookies and local preferences">
        <p>
          JanitorForge uses browser storage and authentication mechanisms needed
          to keep the application working.
        </p>

        <List>
          <li>
            Authentication data may be stored so you can remain signed in.
          </li>

          <li>
            Local browser storage may remember interface preferences such as
            navigation state.
          </li>

          <li>
            Hosting infrastructure may use technically necessary cookies or
            similar mechanisms as part of providing the service.
          </li>
        </List>

        <p>
          Blocking required browser storage may prevent some features, including
          authentication, from working correctly.
        </p>
      </PolicySection>

      <PolicySection number="08" title="Retention and deletion">
        <p>
          Active account and creator data is generally kept for as long as it is
          needed to provide the features you use.
        </p>

        <p>
          When an account or content is deleted, JanitorForge removes or
          schedules removal of associated information where technically
          supported. Some residual information may temporarily remain in
          backups, logs, cached systems, moderation records, or storage
          infrastructure.
        </p>

        <p>
          Content that was shared with collaborators or copied outside
          JanitorForge may also continue to exist independently of your account.
        </p>

        <p>
          Security and abuse-prevention records may be retained for a reasonable
          period where they are needed to protect the platform or investigate
          misuse.
        </p>
      </PolicySection>

      <PolicySection number="09" title="Security">
        <p>
          JanitorForge uses technical safeguards intended to reduce unauthorized
          access and protect stored information.
        </p>

        <List>
          <li>Encrypted HTTPS connections for data in transit.</li>
          <li>Authentication controls for account access.</li>
          <li>
            Database access rules designed to limit users to information they
            are allowed to access.
          </li>
          <li>
            Permission checks for collaborative and administrative actions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Abuse-prevention and moderation controls for public submissions.
          </li>
        </List>

        <p>
          No online service can guarantee perfect security. JanitorForge is
          actively developed, and security-related issues are treated as
          something to investigate and improve rather than something the project
          claims can never happen.
        </p>
      </PolicySection>

      <PolicySection number="10" title="Your controls and privacy rights">
        <p>
          JanitorForge provides direct controls for much of the information
          associated with your account.
        </p>

        <List>
          <li>View and edit your profile.</li>
          <li>Change profile visibility settings.</li>
          <li>Create, edit, publish, unpublish, or remove creator content.</li>

          <li>Delete your account through platform settings.</li>

          Depending on where you live, local privacy law may give you additional
          rights concerning access, correction, deletion, restriction, or
          objection to certain processing.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you need help exercising a privacy-related right that is not
          available directly in the interface, contact JanitorForge through the
          platform.

        <p>
          JanitorForge does not knowingly maintain accounts belonging to users
          known to be under that age. If an underage account is identified,
          appropriate action may be taken, including removal of the account.

        <p>
          Profiles, Creator Pages, community content, and other parts of

        <p>
          JanitorForge is still in Beta, so the platform and the information it

        <p>
          If this Privacy Policy changes meaningfully, the date at the top will
          be updated. Important changes may also be communicated through the
