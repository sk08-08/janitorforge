        <p>
          JanitorForge is an independent toolkit for creators to manage bots,
          forms, submissions, profiles, creator pages, collaboration, and
          related content.
        </p>

        <p>
          These Terms describe the basic rules for using the platform. By using
          JanitorForge, you agree to follow them. If you do not agree with the
          rules, please do not use the platform.
        </p>

        <p>
          JanitorForge is still in Beta. These Terms may change as features,
          moderation needs, and the project itself evolve.
        </p>
      </TermsSection>

      <TermsSection number="02" title="Age requirement">
        <p>
          You must be at least <Strong>18 years old</Strong> to use
          JanitorForge.
        </p>

        <p>
          By creating or using an account, you confirm that you meet this
          requirement.
        </p>
      </TermsSection>

      <TermsSection number="03" title="Your account">
        <p>JanitorForge accounts currently use a username and PIN.</p>

        <List>
          <li>Keep your PIN private.</li>
          <li>
            Do not intentionally give another person access to your account.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you believe somebody has gained unauthorized access, report it as
            soon as reasonably possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            You are responsible for activity performed through your account
            unless it resulted from a platform security issue or unauthorized
            access outside your reasonable control.
          </li>
        </List>
      </TermsSection>

      <TermsSection number="04" title="Your content">
        <p>
          You keep whatever rights you already have in the content you create,
          write, or upload to JanitorForge.
        </p>

        <p>
          JanitorForge does not claim ownership of your bots, writing, images,
          forms, Creator Pages, lore, or other creator content simply because
          you use the platform.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are responsible for making sure you have the right to upload or
          publish the content you place on JanitorForge.
        </p>

        <Subheading>Permission needed to operate the platform</Subheading>

        <p>
          When you upload, save, publish, or share content, you give
          JanitorForge the limited permission necessary to store, process,
          display, transmit, and otherwise handle that content so the feature
          you chose can work.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, a public profile cannot work unless JanitorForge is
          allowed to display the profile information you chose to publish.
        </p>

        <Subheading>Backups are still a good idea</Subheading>

        <p>
          JanitorForge tries to protect stored content, but no Beta project or
          online service can promise that data will never be lost. Keep your own
          copy of anything you consider important.
        </p>
      </TermsSection>

      <TermsSection number="05" title="Public and shared content">
        <p>
          If you make something public, share a public link, or invite another
          creator into a collaboration, other people may be able to see that
          content.
        </p>

        <p>
          People who can see content may also be able to copy, screenshot, or
          otherwise retain it outside JanitorForge. The platform cannot control
          copies made outside its systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Visibility and access settings should therefore be treated as tools
          for controlling access inside JanitorForge, not as a guarantee that
          something another person has already seen can be erased from their
          possession.
        </p>
      </TermsSection>

      <TermsSection number="06" title="Treat other people like people">
        <p>
          JanitorForge includes public profiles, forms, comments, collaboration,
          submissions, and other ways for people to interact. Do not use those
          tools to deliberately harm other users.
        </p>

        <p>In particular, do not:</p>

        <List>
          <li>Use JanitorForge for illegal activity.</li>
          <li>
            Harass, threaten, intimidate, or deliberately target another person.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use Forms or submissions to send abusive, threatening, or harmful
            messages to creators.
          </li>
          <li>Promote hatred or targeted abuse against protected groups.</li>
          <li>Impersonate another person in a deceptive or harmful way.</li>
          <li>
            Infringe intellectual-property rights you do not have permission to
            use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Upload malware, malicious scripts, or intentionally harmful files.
          </li>
          <li>
            Attempt to gain unauthorized access to accounts, data, moderation
            systems, or infrastructure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spam, scrape, automate, or overload JanitorForge in ways that harm
            the service or its users.
          </li>
        </List>

        <p>
          Context matters. Moderation decisions may take into account intent,
          severity, repetition, and the effect on other users rather than
          relying only on one isolated word or action.
        </p>
      </TermsSection>

      <TermsSection number="07" title="Moderation">
        <p>
          JanitorForge does not manually review everything people create or
          submit.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, content, accounts, submissions, or activity may be reviewed,
          restricted, removed, or blocked when there is a reasonable reason to
          believe they violate these Terms, create a safety problem, abuse the
          service, or expose JanitorForge to legal or security risk.
        </p>

        <p>
          Moderation tools are imperfect. Automated flags do not necessarily
          mean a person has broken a rule, and they may be reviewed before
          further action is taken where appropriate.
        </p>
      </TermsSection>

      <TermsSection number="08" title="Collaboration">
        <p>
          Some JanitorForge tools allow creators to share access to bots or
          related workspaces.
        </p>

        <List>
          <li>
            Collaborators may be able to view or edit shared content according
            to the permissions they receive.
          </li>
          <li>
            Collaboration activity may be recorded so participants can
            understand what changed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Owners can remove collaborators where the feature supports it.

          <li>
            Do not invite somebody to content you are not allowed to share with
            them.
          </li>
        </List>

        <p>
          JanitorForge provides collaboration tools, but it is not responsible
          for settling personal disagreements, creative ownership disputes, or
          private agreements between collaborators.

            Submitters are responsible for the content they send through a form.

            JanitorForge provides the form and workflow tools but is not a party

        <p>
          Payment disputes, delivery promises, commission terms, refunds, and
          similar arrangements must be handled between the people involved
